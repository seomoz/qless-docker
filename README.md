# Qless Docker

This repository gives the ability to create a docker container which
runs the [Qless](https://github.com/seomoz/qless) API (or the Qless web app).

Now available directly from Docker Hub as
[`seomoz/qless-ui`](https://hub.docker.com/r/seomoz/qless-ui/).

```
docker pull seomoz/qless-ui
```

# Build instructions

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## Build steps

1. `docker build -t seomoz/qless-ui .`

The built image has a directory at `/qless` which contains the qless web
application.

# How do I run the container?

When you want to run the container, you'll need to pass two environment
variables to `docker run ...` to successfully start the container:

1. `REDIS_URL`: e.g. `redis://some-host:7000/3`
   or alternative those 3:
   1. `REDIS_HOST`: The host which is running the redis instance you want
      to connect to. E.g. `www.example.com`
   1. `REDIS_PORT`: The port on the host which is running redis. E.g.
      `6379`.
   1. `DB_NUM`: The redis DB number that the app will connect to.  Defaults
      to 0.
1. `HTTP_PATH`: Optional, the path that the web app will be listening on. default
   `/qless`

An example way of running the docker container is to run:

```bash
docker run -d --net="host" -e "REDIS_HOST=localhost" -e "REDIS_PORT=6379" -e "HTTP_PATH=/qless" seomoz/qless-ui
# or
docker run -e REDIS_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0" seomoz/qless-ui
```

To run the docker container connecting to a specific redis database use:

```bash
docker run -d --net="host" -e "REDIS_HOST=localhost" -e "REDIS_PORT=6379" -e "HTTP_PATH=/qless" -e "DB_NUM=15" seomoz/qless-ui
```

Assuming that the docker container is running on `localhost`, then to
access the web UI, you can run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/qless
```
